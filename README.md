# Quantum Convolution Neural Network For Prediction Of Diabetes Retinopathy
Using Quantum circuits and feature maps to improve the efficiency of Classical Deep learning based classifier model. 


**Brief Summary :-**

Addressed the growing concern of diabetic retinopathy in India by devising an solution at the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning. Developed a quantum-enhanced deep convolutional neural network that integrates quantum computing's potential with image classification methods. This novel approach outperformed conventional techniques, achieving very High accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and f1-score in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy severity levels using the Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) over the classical deep learning based CNN models.
